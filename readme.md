# Simple Calculator

## What is it?

A calculator! This is my first functioning, interactive Android app.

## Why does it exist?

I built this as an exercise in Java and XML. It was also meant to serve as an opportunity to learn the Android Studio development environment.

## Technology used

This is built on Java, using Android Studio with Gradle. It targets a minimum Android SDK of 28.
